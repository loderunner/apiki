# Go Formatting

When fixing formatting issues in Go files, **always run the formatter first**
before attempting manual edits.

## Command

```shell
go tool golangci-lint fmt ./...
```

Or for a specific file:

```shell
go tool golangci-lint fmt path/to/file.go
```

## Workflow

1. Run `go tool golangci-lint fmt` to auto-fix formatting issues
2. Re-check lints to see what remains
3. Only manually fix issues that the formatter cannot handle

Do not attempt to manually fix spacing, indentation, import ordering, or other
formatting issues that `golangci-lint fmt` handles automatically.
