# Go Linting

When working with Go code, run the linter yourself rather than relying solely on
IDE diagnostics. This provides more accurate and complete feedback.

## Commands

Format code:

```shell
go tool golangci-lint fmt ./...
```

Lint code:

```shell
go tool golangci-lint run ./...
```

## Workflow

**Always run the formatter before the linter.** The formatter fixes issues that
would otherwise appear as lint errors.

1. Run `go tool golangci-lint fmt ./...` to auto-format
2. Run `go tool golangci-lint run ./...` to check for remaining issues
3. Fix any reported problems

## When to Run

Run the formatter and linter:

- After making substantive edits to Go files
- When the IDE reports linter errors — running the tools directly provides
  better insight into the actual issues
- Before considering a task complete

## Targeting Specific Files

For faster feedback on specific files or packages:

```shell
go tool golangci-lint fmt path/to/file.go
go tool golangci-lint run path/to/package/...
```

## Notes

- The IDE will not show all lint errors. Run the commands manually to see all
issues.
- The IDE will not refresh the lint errors when you save the file. The commands
are the source of truth. If the IDE finds linter issues after running the
commands, ignore the IDE's errors.
